# Learning PyTorch From Basic

## 1 - Introduction

-   Learn how to create, manipulate, and doing aggregation function with PyTorch Tensor
-   Learn how to create Linear Regression model using nn.Module to create the model and nn.Parameter to create the weights and bias, and use L1Loss (MAE) for loss function and SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) for optimizer function
-   Learn how to create Binary Classification model and Multiclass Classification with nn.Linear (Dense layer) and nn.ReLU (Activation function), and calculate the accuracy using torchmetrics

## 2 - Deep Learning

-   Learn how to load image dataset using torchvision.dataset
-   Learn how to create DataLoader for generating training and testing data
-   Learn how to create Multiclass Image Classification model with Convolutional Neural Network

## 3 - Datasets
